backpocket
==========

A new native cache for your iOS apps.

Backpocket is a framework and library for easily creating cache for your apps with native TCP socket based communication layer to a server. Name drives from a person's habbit of keeping things in his/her backpocket for easy access and drop/eject the items from it when they expire or become useless. 

Look at the SampleOjectCache example code to know how you can use the library for populating a table view in your app using a cache which communicates natively to your TCP server.
